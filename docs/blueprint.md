# **App Name**: RideReply

## Core Features:

- Ride Detection: Automatically detect when the user is riding a bike using device sensors (accelerometer, GPS, etc.).
- Auto-Reply Activation: Once a ride is detected, activate auto-reply to incoming calls and messages.
- Customizable Message: Allow the user to customize the automated reply message (e.g., 'I'm currently riding a bike and will respond later.').
- Contact Whitelist: Allow the user to whitelist certain contacts who will not receive the auto-reply.
- Call Screening: Screen incoming calls based on user-defined rules. Decide, using AI as a tool, whether to send the canned response based on factors like time of day, contact priority, etc.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep sky blue (#00BFFF) for calmness and focus during rides.
- Background color: Light blue (#E0F8FF), a heavily desaturated variant of deep sky blue.
- Accent color: A lighter periwinkle (#CCCCFF) to contrast against the sky blue elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif font with a modern look that's suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, recognizable icons for ride detection, message customization, and contact settings.
- A clean, straightforward layout for easy access to core settings during setup.
- Subtle transitions and animations to indicate when ride detection is active.
